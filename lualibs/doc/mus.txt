mus.lua contains various musical functions and variables:

mode(i, k, table):
k is mode, i is the step to look up in the mode, and table is the base scale
table to use for lookup, defaults to a major scale (yielding Ionian, dorian, etc
for various values of k)
returns the number of half steps from the base of the mode

makemode(k, table):
makes a function to use like mode, except that it only receives the step in the
mode (i in the above mode explanation) as it's argument (call like newmode(i))

makescale(table):
receives a table to make a function to use like newscale(i). this looks up the
i+1th member of table and returns it

fixscale(table):
fixes a scale in-place. Flattens the array, sorts it, and bases it to start at 0

m(i): return ith (0-based) member of natural minor scale
M(i): major scale
hm(i): harmonic minor
mm(i): melodic minor

name: this is an array for note names: items with indices 1-12 are arrays of
chromatic nearest note names in c major, enharmonics have flats as the first
item. example: name[4][2] is the string "ds" (d-sharp). name[1][1] is "c", there
is no name[1][2].
There are also numbers indexed by name, but only diatonic names, this time the
numbers are based on 0, so name["d"] = 2

note(list):
list can be a single argument or table of arguments. receives midi key numbers
and outputs names in the format : "notename""quartertone inflection""octave
number"
(rounds to the nearest 1/4 tone) example output: "df<3"
returns single note or table of the same

keynum(list, octave):
same, except that it receives either a hz value or a key name in the above
format or table of the same, returns midi key number. octave sets octave, and is
sticky throughout the list

hertz(list, octave):
same, except receives midi note instead of hz and outputs hz

pclass(list):
same format, gets the pitch class of the input

transpose(ref, amount):
simply adds ref to amount, keeps ref as notes if given as notes.
if ref is a number < 12, the result is % 12
