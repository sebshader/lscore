oscpat is for having an oscillator pattern that functions as a low-frequency oscillator for the purpose of composition.

oscpat.new(type, part, phase, pwm): returns new oscillator pattern
	next(): (next value)
	osctype(type): set the oscillator type. comes with the choices: "sin",
		"saw", "tri", or "sqr" for sine, sawtooth, triangle, or square.
		waveforms. Defaults to "sin", set by type in the args. All waveforms go
		from -1 to 1
	part(inpart): a single cycle corresponds to the number 1, part is the number
		of calls to next() that should be made in order to equal 1 cycle
	per(inper): the inverse of part, this is the number that is incremented on
		each call to next(). mod 1 is taken to get the phase
	pwm(inpwm): sets the pulse-width modulation. Takes a number from 0-1,
		exclusive. The period will be modulated by a constant so that 1/2
		of a cycle will occur by the time of pwm.

map: map is an array of oscillator functions for oscpat to use. Therefore, 
custom oscillators may be created by adding them to map. the index should
be the string that will be passed to osctype and the value should be a
function that responds to phases in the range from 0 to 1

addrdr(array, name): convenience function to add a function to map with index
name. This function will act as a wavetable oscillator by scaling the phase by
the array size and reading from the array.
