to make, type "make" after editing the makefile with the correct paths for lua and pd installations

to install, move pdlload into the same directory as lscore.pd_lua (or another file that has "require pdlload")

-- pdlload reference:
pdlload is an extension for pdlua with the following functions:
pdlload is a bit "hacky" also. (should there be a pdlua.h file?)

pd.Class.loadfile(path): loads lua chunk using the canvas path, returns the chunk

pd.Class.getcpath(): get the class path (where the class was loaded from)

pd.Class.getopath(): get the current object's canvas path. (loadfile could have been directly implemented using this as well, but this is newer)
