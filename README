This is an interface to my Score.lua scripting library. it is for loading
scripts to use inside the Pure Data environment and the pdlua loader. See the
documentation inside lualibs/doc.

Apparently there is an issue with using the format folder/external to load lua
files, so in order to get lscore to work you must put the entire contents of 
the lscore folder, including the created pdlload.so, into pd’s path somewhere

This library will only work with lua 5.1. It uses setfenv extensively.
An extension to pdlua must be compiled, in order to access paths and load
chunks. Please read the readme in pdlload. There is a darwin pdlload.so compiled
inside darwin. At any rate, the compiled pdlload library (e.g. pdlload.so)
should be in the same directory as lscore.pd_lua. See the /doc folder inside the
/lualibs folder for further documentation on the features of the Score.lua
library/system.
